## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently achieved significant success in several graph-related tasks. However, traditional GNNs and their variants are constantly limited by the implicit homophily, assuming neighboring nodes belong to the same class. This results in weak performance on heterophilic graphs where most nodes are linked to neighbors of different classes. Despite the numerous attempts to adequately deal with heterophily, most methods still use the uniform propagation aggregation mechanism. In this paper, we argue that identifying neighbors with different class labels and exploiting them individually is crucial for heterophilic GNNs. We then propose a simple and efficient novel co-training approach, EG-GCN, which uses group aggregation to handle homophilic and heterophilic neighbors separately. In EG-GCN, we first use an edge discriminator to classify edges and split the neighborhood of every node into two parts. We then apply group graph convolution to the divided neighborhoods to obtain node representations. During training, we continuously optimize the edge discriminator to improve neighborhood partition and use the node classification results to identify highly confident unlabeled nodes to expand the edge training set. This co-training strategy enables both components to enhance each other mutually. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EG-GCN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
